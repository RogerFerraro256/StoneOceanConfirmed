this is a project for an autonomous Twitter posting bot, this don't need to be pretty or have an actual site, this will work on Heroku, and this repository is just to save my code

  

# I commented the code to don't have problems during the tests, again, to make it work you should put your twitter keys in the configuration file

  

  

## About the packages i used:
